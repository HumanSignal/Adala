# ADALA

Adala is an Autonomous DatA (Labeling) Agent framework. 

Adala offers a robust framework for implementing agents specialized in
data processing, with a particular emphasis on diverse data labeling
tasks. These agents are autonomous, meaning they can independently
acquire one or more skills through iterative learning. This learning
process is influenced by their operating environment, observations,
and reflections. Users define the environment by providing a ground
truth dataset. Every agent learns and applies its skills in what we
refer to as a "runtime", synonymous with LLM.

Offered as an HTTP server, users can interact with Adala via command
line or RESTful API, and directly integrate its features in Python
Notebooks or scripts. The self-learning mechanism leverages Large
Language Models (LLMs) from providers like OpenAI and VertexAI.

### Why Choose Adala?

- **Specialized in Data Processing**: While our agents excel in diverse
  data labeling tasks, they can be tailored to a wide range of data
  processing needs.
- **Autonomous Learning**: Adala agents aren't just automated;
  they're intelligent. They iteratively and independently develop
  skills based on environment, observations, and reflections.
- **User-Centric Environment Setup**: You have control. Define your
  agent's learning environment simply by providing a ground truth
  dataset.
- **Optimized Runtime**: Our agents operate in a state-of-the-art runtime
  environment, synonymous with LLM, ensuring efficiency and
  adaptability.
- **Extend to your domain**: Build custom agents and skills focused on
  your specific domain.

## Installation

Install ADALA:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/HumanSignal/ADALA.git
cd ADALA/
pip install -e .
```

If you're planning to use human-in-the-loop labeling, or need a
labeling tool to produce ground truth datasets, we suggest installing
Label Studio. Adala is made to support Label Studio format right out
of the box.  

```sh
pip install label-studio
```

## Quickstart

In this example we will use ADALA as a standalone library directly
inside our python notebook. You can open it in Collab right here.

```python
from adala import agents, datasets

# this is the dataset with product reviews
filepath = ""

agent = agents.SingleShotAgent(
    dataset=datasets.PandasDataFrame(
        df=pd.read_csv(filepath, sep='\t', nrows=100)
    ),

    # create runtime
    runtimes={
		"openai": runtimes.OpenAIGPTRuntime(
			model_name='gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct'
		)
	}

	default_runtime="openai",

    # add agent memory
    memory=memories.FileMemory(
        filepath='long_term_memory.jsonl'
    ),
	
    skills={
		"classify": skills.ClassificationSkill(
			name='subjectivity_detection',
			description='Understanding subjective and objective statements from text.',
			instructions='Classify a product review as either expressing "Subjective" or "Objective" statements.'
		)
	}
)

step_result = agent.step()

while step_result.artifact.experience.accuracy < 90 or 
	  step_results.artifact.experience.learnings is not None:
  print(step_result.summarize())
  step_result = agent.step()

print("Done!")
```

## Running ADALA Server

Initiate the Adala server. Note: Each agent operates as its own web server.

### Starting the Adala Server

```sh
# Start the Adala server on default port 8090
adala start
```

### Uploading Ground Truth Data

Before teaching skills to Adala, you need to set up the environment and upload data.

```sh
# Upload your dataset
adala upload --file sample_dataset_ground_truth.json
```

### Teaching Skills to Adala

Now, define and teach a new skill to Adala.

```sh
# Define a new skill for classifying objects
adala add-skill --name "Object Classification" --description "Classify text into categories." --instruction "Example: Label trees, cars, and buildings."
```

```sh
# Start the learning process
adala learn --skill "Object Classification" --continuous
```

### Monitoring Optimization

Track the progress of the optimization process.

```sh
# Check the optimization status
adala status
```

### Applying Skills and Predictions

You don't need to wait for optimization to finish. Instruct Adala to
apply its skills on new data outside the environment, turning Adala
into a prediction engine. If the predictions generated by the skill
are then verified by human validators or another supervision system,
this provides more ground truth data, enhancing the agent's skills.Use
the learned skills and generate predictions.

```sh
# Apply the 'Object Classification' skill on new data
adala apply-skill --name "Object Classification" --file sample_dataset_predict.json
```

adala upload --file sample_dataset_ground_truth.json

# Define a new skill for classifying objects
adala add-skill --name "Object Classification" --description "Classify images into categories." --instruction "Example: Label trees, cars, and buildings."

# Start the learning process
adala learn --skill "Object Classification"

# Apply the 'Object Classification' skill on new data. If you do not pass specific skill it will apply each one
adala predict --skill "Object Classification" --file sample_dataset_predict.json

# Check the optimization status

## How ADALA compares to other agent libraries

## FAQ

- What is an agent?
- Agent is a set of skills and runtimes that could be used to execute
  those skills. Each agent has its own unique environment (dataset)
  attached to it. You can define your own agent class that would have
  a unique set of skills for your domain.

## Interesting Stuff

Skill is a learned ability to solve a specific task. Skill gets
trained from the ground truth dataset.
