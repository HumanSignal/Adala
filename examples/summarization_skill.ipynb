    "    \"Caffeine comes from coffee beans, but it can also be synthesized in a laboratory. It has the same structure whether it’s in coffee, energy drinks, tea, or pills. Caffeine is a powerful stimulant, and it can be used to improve physical strength and endurance. It is classified as a nootropic because it sensitizes neurons and provides mental stimulation. Habitual caffeine use is also associated with a reduced risk of Alzheimer's disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Caffeine’s main mechanism concerns antagonizing adenosine receptors. Adenosine causes sedation and relaxation when it acts upon its receptors, located in the brain. Caffeine prevents this action and causes alertness and wakefulness. This inhibition of adenosine can influence the dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and adrenaline systems. For practical tips on the optimal use of caffeine, check out our Supplement Guides.\",\n",
    "    \"Vitamin C is a water-soluble essential vitamin that can be found in fruits and vegetables, especially citrus. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C from their bodies, so it must be acquired through dietary intake. Vitamin C is important for immune system function and is a powerful antioxidant. It also acts as a cofactor for collagen synthesis.[2]. People often supplement with vitamin C when they have a cold. According to various studies, vitamin C may be effective in reducing the duration of a cold, but does not seem to reduce the frequency of colds in a population.[3][4] The available literature suggests that a dose ranging from 200 mg to 2,000 mg could be beneficial for reducing cold duration.Often utilized for its antioxidant effects, vitamin C has been studied for its potential role in Alzheimer’s disease and cancer. Lower vitamin C levels are present in people with Alzheimer’s, even with adequate dietary intake.[5] It is thought that oxidative stress plays a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease, so vitamin C’s antioxidative effects could be beneficial.[6][7] In rodent studies, oral vitamin C was able to reduce oxidative and inflammatory biomarkers.[8] In recent cancer research, vitamin C was found to promote oxidative stress in cancer cells, leading to cytotoxic effects at high doses in mice.[9] While promising, further research and human studies are required to determine efficacy.\",\n",
    "    \"Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient. It is one of the 24 micronutrients critical for human survival. The sun is the major natural source through eliciting vitamin D production in the skin, but vitamin D is also found naturally in oily fish and eggs and is added to milk and milk alternatives. Supplemental vitamin D is associated with a range of benefits, including improved immune health, bone health, and well-being. Supplementation may also reduce the risk of cancer mortality, diabetes, and multiple sclerosis.The effects of vitamin D likely depend on a person’s circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D; a form of vitamin D that is measured in blood samples to determine vitamin D status), and many of its benefits will only be seen when a deficiency is reversed.\"\n",
