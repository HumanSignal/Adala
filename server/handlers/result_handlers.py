    Abstract base class for a result handler.
    This is a callable that is instantiated in `/submit-streaming` with any arguments that are needed, and then is called on each batch of results when it is finished being processed by the Agent (it consumes from the Kafka topic that the Agent produces to).

    It can be used as a connector to load results into a file or external service. If a ResultHandler is not used, the results will be discarded.

    Subclasses must implement the `__call__` method.

    The BaseModelInRegistry base class implements a factory pattern, allowing the "type" parameter to specify which subclass of ResultHandler to instantiate. For example:
    ```json
    result_handler: {
        "type": "DummyHandler",
        "other_model_field": "other_model_value",
        ...
    }
